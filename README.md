<p>“There is no rule on how to write. Sometimes it comes easily and perfectly: sometimes it’s like drilling rock and then blasting it out with charges” — Ernest Hemingway</p>
<p>Following this notion, here in this project, I have created a system that uses natural language processing and a deep learning system for writing beautiful poems. </p>
