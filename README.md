<p>“There is no rule on how to write. Sometimes it comes easily and perfectly: sometimes it’s like drilling rock and then blasting it out with charges” — Ernest Hemingway</p></p>Following this notion, here in this project, I have created a system that uses natural language processing and a deep learning system for writing beautiful poems.</p>

  <li>Tensorflow</li>
  <li>Keras</li>
  <li>Numpy</li>
  <li>Pandas </li>
  <li>Matplotlib</li>
  <li>Seaborn</li>
  <li>Sklearn</li>
  <li>Spacy</li>
  <li>BeautifulSoup</li>
  <li>Wordcloud</li>
</ul>

<h2>Model Details</h2>
<p>For generating the poetry, I have created a deep learning model that uses two LSTM layers which help the model to remember long-term dependencies and learn the relationship between the poem sentence. The LSTM layers are get followed by two dense layers, one uses RELU as an activation function, and the last dense layer using softmax.</p>
